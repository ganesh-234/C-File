# 🎮 C-File Repository 🎉

Welcome to the **C ++ File Repository**! Dive into my collection of C++ projects, assignments, and experiments. This is where I keep my code explorations, from lab assignments to mini-games. Feel free to explore, test, and play around with the code!

## 🗂 Repository Overview

- **C++ Goffer Game** - Code for a fun project where I experiment with a simple "Goffer" game.
- **Frame** - Includes frame configurations and supporting files.
- **Lab Files** - Organized by lab number:
  - **Lab 3** (`Lab 3.cpp`, `LAb 3.txt`, `LAb 3.png`)
  - **Lab 9** (`lab9.cpp`, `Lab 9.txt`)
- **Assignments** - Check out the source code for various assignments, like `ass11.cpp`.
- **Extras** - Additional supporting files like `frame.h`.
